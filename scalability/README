Clustered mode iozone setup:
----------------------------
Before continuing reading, please make sure the iozone version is greater
than 3.394 to run iozone in clustered mode.

Iozone needs either passwordless rsh or passwordless ssh to be setup to run in
clustered mode.
By default, iozone uses rsh. To force iozone to use ssh, the shell variable RSH
needs to be set to 'ssh'. The command line listed earlier uses this feature.

Contents of the iconf file used [ iozone cluster mode configuration file]:
fusion1 /mnt/fioperf /usr/bin/iozone
fusion1 /mnt/fioperf /usr/bin/iozone
fusion2 /mnt/fioperf /usr/bin/iozone
fusion2 /mnt/fioperf /usr/bin/iozone
fusion3 /mnt/fioperf /usr/bin/iozone
fusion3 /mnt/fioperf /usr/bin/iozone
fusion4 /mnt/fioperf /usr/bin/iozone
fusion4 /mnt/fioperf /usr/bin/iozone
fusion5 /mnt/fioperf /usr/bin/iozone
fusion5 /mnt/fioperf /usr/bin/iozone

[Note that each entry is repeated twice so that two child processes
could be run on each system.]

Pitfalls:

1.When the config file uses IP addresses instead of hostnames,
iozone fails to proceed. For a successful iozone run in clustered mode,
one needs to populate the config file with hostnames.
For name resolution, one could use /etc/hosts.

2.Even after successfully configuring passwordless rsh/ssh,
if you are unable to run iozone, make sure you flush firewall rules

To look at the configured firewall rules, one could use:
# iptables -L

To flush the rules, once could use:
# iptables -F
